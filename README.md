Welcome to OpenBlink! An Open-source tool for Blink RNG in Pokemon Colosseum (and soon Gales!)

This project began when existing closed-source Blink tools were taken off the web, 
leaving shiny hunters and speedrunners without an ethical way to determine seed from blinks.

Other tools have recreated the syncing and calibration aspect of blink, but this tool is the first to
re-create the seed finding aspect of the process.

This is a command-line tool for windows at the moment. There are plans to roll-out a full GUI in the future.

If you'd like to know more about how it works, or you'd like to contribute, let me know! I'm always available to answer
questions and hear feedback.

Shoutouts to Lincoln for their help in the CoTool decomp, and to Blisy for testing + education on the topic.
