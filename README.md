Welcome to OpenBlink! An Open-source tool for Blink RNG in Pokemon Colosseum and Gales!

This project began when existing closed-source Blink tools were taken off the web, 
leaving shiny hunters and speedrunners without an ethical and user-friendly way to determine seed from blinks.

Other tools have recreated the syncing and calibration aspect of blink, but this tool is the first to
re-create the seed finding aspect of the process. 

This has been recently updated to have a full GUI!

If you'd like to know more about how it works, or you'd like to contribute, let me know! I'm always available to answer
questions and hear feedback.

Thank you to Lincoln for the intial Co-Tool decomp, as well as Blisy and Twisty for their help in bug-testing.
